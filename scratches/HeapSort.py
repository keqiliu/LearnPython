What is Heap Sort?

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
It has a time complexity of O( n log(n) ) in all cases (worst, average, and best),
making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

It is also an in-place algorithm, meaning it doesnâ€™t require extra memory.

No need to really build a tree, use index to find

for each idx:
left = 2 * idx + 1
right = 2* idx + 2
